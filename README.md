This is a basic port of Dean Edward's Base javascript library for inheritance. You can find his original description [here](http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2006/03/base/).

This port will be turned into a proper node.js module/package as soon as I get around to it, but for now to can be imported into a node project using the standard `var Base = requires('PATH/TO/base.js');`.

I'm also working on an eventual fork of this library that adds some generic type checking.
